#  Project- HR Analytics
 We have employee data of Atliq Tech from 3 months in excel sheet.Need to find working preference of people and provide some insights.
 I have learned how to gather and transform data using Power Query. Power Query is a feature in Power BI which helps to collect and transform the data the way we want. We have our data in excel and in multiple sheets with different column headers. This is a special case and found the solution.
  then  created metrics using DAX.
 created a usable dashboard. Also learned some dashboarding techniques which is a very important skill to acquire.
