 I have learned how to gather and transform data using Power Query. Power Query is a feature in Power BI which helps to collect and transform the data the way we want. We have our data in excel and in multiple sheets with different column headers. This is a special case and found the solution.

 created a usable dashboard. Also learned some dashboarding techniques which is a very important skill to acquire.
